#  skipify

A command-line utility to run alongside Spotify that automatically jumps to certain sections of the currently playing track.

#### Motivation
The idea behind skipify was to create a utility that would allow me to monitor my spotify's currenlty playing track and would automatically skip to a certain predefined position in the track.

To install dependencies:
```bash
# Install
bun install

# Run
bun run src/index.ts
```


This project was created using `bun init`  [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
